# ðŸŒ² forest-focus

Little app to stay focused while your forest is growing.  
Each time you focus, trees pop up one by one. Thatâ€™s it. Just nature and time.

Built with Angular, and a canvas grid.  
Works with weighted randomness to vary species and positions.

No account, no timer stress, just a peaceful forest growing.

## Maybe later ?

I might add some small things like saving forest, seasonal themes, more diverse tiles (like houses, background elements) etc.

## About this project

I built this app over a week.
It was a fun way to learn about perspective, canvas and tile editing.  
If it helps you focus for a few minutes, thatâ€™s already a win for me.

Thanks for checking it out.

## Credits

Some of the trees and tiles come from this nice tileset:
