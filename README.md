# ğŸŒ² forest-focus

Little app to stay focused while your forest is growing.  
Each time you focus, trees pop up one by one. Thatâ€™s it. Just nature and time.

Built with Angular, and a canvas grid.  
Works with weighted randomness to vary species and positions.

No account, no timer stress, just a peaceful forest growing.

## Maybe later ?

I might add some small things like saving forest, seasonal themes, more diverse tiles (like houses, background elements) etc.

## About this project

I built this app over a week.
It was a fun way to learn about perspective, canvas and tile editing.  
If it helps you focus for a few minutes, thatâ€™s already a win for me.

Thanks for checking it out.

## Credits

Some of the trees and tiles come from this nice tileset:

Made by [Yar](https://opengameart.org/users/yar) â€“ thanks!

# FocusForest

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
